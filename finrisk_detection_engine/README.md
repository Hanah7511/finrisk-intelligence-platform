## Overview

The `finrisk_detection_engine` is the detection backbone of the Financial Risk Intelligence Platform. It ingests raw transaction data, applies multiple detection layers, fuses risk signals, and generates alerts that are passed to `finintel_sentinel_ai` for autonomous investigation.

## Detection Pipeline

MULTI-SOURCE DATA LAYER
(Banking Transactions + Customer Data + Device Data + KYC Records + Regulatory Documents)
    ↓
DATA INGESTION LAYER
(CSV + SQL Server + APIs + Kafka Streaming)
    ↓
DATA VALIDATION LAYER
(Missing Values + Schema Validation + Duplicate Checks + Type Validation)
    ↓
DATA PREPROCESSING LAYER
(Cleaning + Encoding + Scaling + Timestamp Processing + Feature Normalization)
    ↓
SQL ANALYTICS & HISTORICAL FEATURE LAYER
(Transaction Aggregation + Behavioral History + Velocity Metrics + Device Intelligence)
    ↓
FEATURE ENGINEERING LAYER
(SQL Behavioral Features + Python ML Features + Velocity Features + Risk Indicators)
    ↓
RULE-BASED AML ENGINE
(Structuring Rules + Sanctions Flags + Geo-Risk Rules + Velocity Rules + Threshold Rules)
    ↓
STATISTICAL ANOMALY DETECTION LAYER
(Z-Score + IQR + MAD + Percentile-Based Detection)
    ↓
UNSUPERVISED & HYBRID ML ANOMALY DETECTION LAYER
(Isolation Forest + LOF + One-Class SVM + Ensemble Anomaly Scoring)
    ↓
SUPERVISED FRAUD CLASSIFICATION LAYER
(Logistic Regression + Random Forest + XGBoost)
    ↓
RISK FUSION ENGINE
(Combines Statistical + Rule-Based + ML + Behavioral Risk Scores)
    ↓
GRAPH ML FEATURE LAYER
(Customer Relationships + Shared Devices + Transaction Networks + Suspicious Connection Mapping)
    ↓
GNN FRAUD RING DETECTION LAYER
(GraphSAGE for Fraud Ring & Network Fraud Detection)
    ↓
ALERT SEVERITY ENGINE
(Low / Medium / High / Critical Risk Prioritization)
    ↓
CASE MANAGEMENT & HUMAN FEEDBACK LOOP
(Analyst Validation + False Positive Review + Investigator Notes + Audit Logging)
    ↓
→ Alerts passed to FinIntel Sentinel AI for investigation
